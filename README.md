- Xschem 
    - Xschem is a schematic capture program; it allows the creation of hierarchical representation of circuits with a top down approach. By focusing on interfaces, hierarchy, and instance properties, a complex system can be described in terms of simpler building blocks. A VHDL or Verilog, or Spice netlist can be generated from the drawn schematic, allowing the simulation of the circuit. The key feature of the program is its drawing engine written in C and uses the Xlib drawing primitives; this gives very good speed performance, even in huge circuits. The user interface is built with the Tcl-Tk toolkit; TCL is also the extension language used.
